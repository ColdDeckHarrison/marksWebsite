# marksWebsite
personal website

Built from the ground up with HTML5, CSS3 and javascript. This site includes a massive amount of Bootstrap which also includes the import of JS and Jquery. 
I built this app origninally in ATOM but I wanted to include a contact me page with some of the benefits and security of Flask and Python. Currently, however, the contact me page is not working as the site is hosted on Heroku and the hack between github and heroku made all auth tokens null. The site is still live but is being committed and pushed from my local server to heroku through Git. I will also continue to push updates to the files here but it will not be as often as I update my website, which is weekly.

My site is a responsive site but it has not yet gotten to the point of being perfectly optimized for phone use. It is a work in progress and with every change tot eh code it must continue to be tested and checked for even the slightest changes to the overall utility of the website. This is a major showcase item and with eachnew skill or technology I learn, I will try to find a thoughtful way to incorrporate it into the exsisting website. I think some form of login will be included next with React.JS though I have not made any real considerations about that inclusion yet. 

If you do look more deeply into the actual coding portion of the website you will see a ton of commented out code. I have left previous iterations of ideas in to show the evolution of the work as well as, allowing me to consider using the code elsewhere without having to start from scratch. I wrote the code, might as well keep it around in a low risk space if I need it in the future. 

In addition to showcasing my CV, CODEWARS and new BLOG. I am going to be adding a great deal more in terms of video and images. How and where is still to be decided. As I stated before this project is a testing ground for a variety of interests.
