Motivated by the </span><span class="c17"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lavaforgood.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650294091162594&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nAXo8Nm5azNwFK8E-OwJ1">Wrongful Conviction Podcast</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and specifically a comment in the podcast by JJ Velazquez. He made a point to give the address, his inmate number and how to contact him and what it would mean to him if people would write to him while he was wrongly imprisoned. He made mention of how there were so many guys that would never get mail and that the mail he did get was the difference between being able to survive or the loss of all hope. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">My blog about this journey will not be a commentary on the prison industrial complex or my views on the American prison system, there are enough of those types of blogs and articles written by far more informed people than myself. I have opinions on everything from over sentencing, corruption, inequity of incarceration, inequitable systems of repayment for time served depending on the state and if and how they were released, Alfred pleas and more. &nbsp;My goal is to make those individuals more accessible while they are behind bars because a simple letter can make all the difference in the world and might just help to save some of our humanity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Now I will go over the larger plan for the concept, the smaller goals, what I do not want my work to be used for and I will explain what the system looks like now, for those who want to find an address. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
          <br> <br><ol class="c22 lst-kix_xaemukv5og05-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">A single site that houses all of the information required to write to any prisoner in the United States. It will be a searchable database that allows the user to pick by state and even look at the charges against the individual. At some point, perhaps I will also link public court documents so that users can understand the cases prior to writing or maybe I will try to create alerts for those released, currently in appeals, min-max-supermax housing facilities and death row inmates. The ultimate goal is to make people more accessible to anyone that wants to write a letter. One major issue that I can see prior to any of the work is that there will be potentially dozens or hundreds of places this information is stored for single states, those in jails awaiting trials (this could be for extended periods of time, over a year) and the movement of people between different institutions. </span></li><br>
              <li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">The smaller goals: This starts with a single state. I could start with a small state like Rhode Island, Delaware or North Dakota as they are relatively unpopulated states. However, I want to make sure that this project can be scaled to encompass every state. I will start in Oklahoma as they have one of the highest rates of convictions being overturned leading to pardons and exonerations. </span></li><br>
              <li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">I am building this site/program for the average well-intentioned Earth citizen. Lawyers that want to ambulance chase with my data, this is not for them. This is not for anyone to make money from, the system is already corrupt enough without more money changing hands because of my work. This site is 100% designed for people that want to do something above and beyond donating to the innocence project in their state or any of the other fantastic programs that help provide free legal services for those already incarcerated. I don&rsquo;t have a ton of money, I assume most people are like me. They want to do a good thing but don&rsquo;t know how. </span></li><br>
              <li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Here is the good part! I have the address for an individual on the Oklahoma death row. This is important because it is a confirmed address that will allow me to be 100% certain when I find the address through my search. I now have something to compare it to, in this case. SO I hit Google with an &ldquo;Oklahoma Department of corrections&rdquo; search. The second hit was (https://okoffender.doc.ok.gov/) an inmate search where I could type in the inmate &ldquo;ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;First Name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Last Name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Date of Birth&rdquo;. It even let me pull information for similar sounding names. THIS IS A GOOD SITE! BUUUT, it is not what I want. This assumes that I know who I am looking for, not just looking for someone to write. Additionally when I searched for the individual, I found that an image was provided, the ID was provided as well as the facility. These are all good things to know but not everything I need to know. In addition to needing to know &ldquo;the who&rdquo; I am looking for, this does not provide the format needed to send him a letter. I am able to click and see the charges he was convicted of, which is also of interest as I plan on incorporating that into my own ability to search. Once I was into his profile I had to click on the facility name, this brought me to a page with a few dozen facilities in the state. I found the facility he is in and clicked around until I found the mailing address (different from the physical location). At this point I can see the format needed so that any letter I send will get to the intended individual. NOTE: There is a portion of the address that asks for the housing block assignment and for the example I have that information but in my research to this point, that information is not otherwise known, likely due to the fact that people move in and out of different housing units at a rate faster than could be updated by the owner of the website. </span></li></ol><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The webpage (</span><span class="c17"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oklahoma.gov/doc/facilities.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650294091164364&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BTI1mS_yeB_o5AXQ0x9DK">https://oklahoma.gov/doc/facilities.html</a></span>
              <span class="c4">) holds 24 corrections facilities, each requiring a couple clicks to get to the mailing address. Most do show that the mailing address is the physical location of the facility unlike my test case. Additionally, on the bottom row there is a private facilities image with two facilities nested inside with separate links to their pages. The rabbit hole is getting deeper. Also on the last row in the last column there is a page for halfway houses. This adds another level of complexity when looking for people.</span></p>

It&#39;s a common enough name and I wanted to see what the search results would look like. I ended up getting 20 pages of data. Most of the pages were full of individuals whose accounts were inactive. The person(s) in these cases are on probation, released or their profile was empty.

I have started my second day of work on this project and messed around with a few of my initial ideas. I downloaded both Octoparse and Parsehub in order to scrape </span><span class="c17"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://okoffender.doc.ok.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650294091172591&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rbUBxWfQS-hbqeTvcmNwE">https://okoffender.doc.ok.gov/</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Octoparse was a pain from the start so I promptly deleted it with no remorse. I then started the tutorial for Parsehub. I found the program to be fairly easy to learn to the point that I created my own project and trained the crawler to create a CSV file in the format of:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="t.85730383879e3a782fb9f57c4b7d339c4fbc27ab"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c19"><tbody><tr class="c8"><td class="c1 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c6">OK DOC #</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c3">Name</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c3">Gender</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c3">Race</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c3">DOB</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c9">Facility</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c3">47787</span></p></td><td class="c13 c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Andrews, Rodney T</span></p></td><td class="c1 c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Male</span></p></td><td class="c1 c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">White</span></p></td><td class="c1 c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c6">04/17/1918</span></p></td><td class="c1 c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">INACTIVE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c8"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c3">55454</span></p></td><td class="c13 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Aldrich, Larry R</span></p></td><td class="c1 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Male</span></p></td><td class="c1 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">White</span></p></td><td class="c1 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c6">01/01/1979</span></p></td><td class="c1 c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c6">INACTIVE</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I was able to train it to go to all subsequent pages after scraping the wanted data from the current page as well. The challenges I face with the site I am scraping is the recaptcha which I have not yet found a reasonable solution for. Additionally once every page is scraped from last names starting with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; the program would need to run for every letter of the alphabet or 25 more times. These hang-ups are not so insurmountable but they will require more time and effort as these are seemingly still above my current technical skills. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I am thrilled to be facing this challenge here as this site does contain every person currently and formerly locked in a facility within the state. This completely reduces the number of other places I must go to find information. One thing I have learned about Oklahoma is that, if nothing else, they have organized and really done a great job at making and keeping prisoners organized digitally. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Once a full scrape of each letter has been completed I can write a boolean in python that moves all inactive prisoners to a separate chart. Those remaining will have the stored mailing addresses attached to variables and a series of (if, elseif and else) statements being made == to the current facility will return the address to the correctly corresponding inmate. This should make replacing that information easier for me overall when dealing with hundreds and thousands of people. Additionally, I want to make sure to remember that I create a way for any selected person&rsquo;s information to be given to the user of the site in the correct mailing format required by the institution. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This should likely be done every month, depending on how often the information contained within is updated. I will need to conduct further research as I am sure each prison and each state does this differently. Also, these updates may be programmed in based on the length of the sentences. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">My friend Kyle also made a thoughtful remark about how I might use the inactive accounts. With a thoughtful python script I could iterate through the dates of release and if the date is within a range of 1 year(??? Maybe longer) the data can be returned to a place where those individuals could be found by local businesses for potential job opportunities. This plan will need additional time to fleshed out but I do think there is some serious potential to the idea. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ndash; A note to self&ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Self doubt about whether or not I can deliver on this project is creeping in. Do I know enough to do this? Can I create a functional front and back end to store this data? Am I spending my time and energy on something that will die in the dark regions of the interwebs? I want this to work, I need this to be a good idea because I think it&rsquo;s important. Is that enough?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Until I get some insight and inspiration about how to deal with the above mentioned pitfalls, I have created a </span><span class="c17"><a class="c18" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fmN4Ev9CKY8fkIxjueRpEj2s0h8F5yDF33QAIiJZvlU/edit%23gid%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650294091181296&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_hk95--E8O13tLtD5X5JU">Google Sheets</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;form and I am copy/pasting the information into the sheets and will work on scripting and manipulating the data. Not every problem will be easily solved but I do think that if I make progress in one area a day this project can start looking like something useful eventually. The individuals with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the beginning of their last name is well over 100 pages.

I see that in the 2nd position in the list of all names we have Mr. Addington and when I called all data from position 2 in the list everything about him was printed in the console. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While this appears to be very basic to this point. I feel really great about using the CSV data I will be scraping from these websites in the future and being able to manipulate much larger pieces of data with simple codes within my Python environment. I still have some testing I would like to do about editing or amending the file, creating new files with data from the current file and ultimately deleting files that are completely irrelevant if the person is deceased or otherwise not the target of this project or the potential expansion idea. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c22 lst-kix_eqap54uw9wp8-0 start"><li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">- &nbsp;A Note about my research - -</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span>I went through 80 pages of inmate data for individuals with a last name starting with the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; within those 80 pages there were probably a total of 15 inmates listed as currently serving time with the prison facility name listed. I read the list of items each of these people were convicted of and when. Of these 1 was incorrect and the inmate had actually already been released. With this in mind, it might be that the website is not regularly updated. Otherwise, it may be that a conviction and sentence had occurred that was not yet documented in the paperwork. Finally, it could be a situation not considered above. This may happen from time to time which reinforces why it will be important to include the conviction data with the other information so that when a future searcher finds someone they might like to correspond with, they can double check the information and make a more informed decision based on the full scope of the information. Even if my code is done correctly I won&rsquo;t be able to control potential issues such as this single instance. </span></p><div class="c14"><p class="c10"></span></p><p class="c10 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><br><br></div></body></html>
